//! Receive-lifecycle events for programmatic consumers (e.g. the desktop tray app).
//!
//! The CLI surfaces the same transitions via JSON NDJSON on stdout
//! (see [`crate::output::ReceiveEventJson`]). This enum is the plain-Rust twin,
//! emitted to an optional [`tokio::sync::mpsc::UnboundedSender`] plugged into
//! [`crate::server::ServerState`]. CLI callers pass `None`; the desktop app
//! passes `Some(tx)` to drive system notifications and tray state without
//! parsing stdout.
