# lsend

Headless command-line tool for sending and receiving files over the local network, compatible with the [LocalSend](https://localsend.org) protocol.

## Requirements

- Rust 1.75+

> The LocalSend Rust `core` crate is vendored under `vendor/localsend-core/` — no need to clone the upstream repository.

## Build

```bash
git clone <this-repo-url>
cd lsend
cargo build --release
# binary at: target/release/lsend
```

To install into `~/.cargo/bin/`:

```bash
cargo install --path .
```

## Usage

```bash
# Discover nearby devices
lsend scan

# Manage persisted device alias (device name)
lsend alias show
lsend alias regenerate
lsend alias set "My Laptop"

# Receive files (auto-accept, saves to ~/Downloads by default)
lsend receive

# Send files to a device (IP address or alias from scan)
lsend send 192.168.1.42 ./photo.png ./notes.txt
echo "hello" | lsend send 192.168.1.42 --text
lsend send 192.168.1.42 --message "hello"
lsend send 192.168.1.42 --clipboard
```

### Global options

| Flag | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `--http` | Use plain HTTP instead of HTTPS |
| `--port PORT` | Listen/connect port (default: 53317). Keep 53317 for receive — alternate ports break multicast discovery. |
| `--alias NAME` | Device display name for one command (overrides alias.txt) |
| `-v, --verbose` | Print diagnostic logs on stderr |
| `--json` | Machine-readable JSON on stdout (see [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md)) |
| `-q, --quiet` | Suppress progress text (human mode; implied by `--json`) |

### Per-subcommand options

| Subcommand | Flag | Description |
|------------|------|-------------|
| `scan` | `--timeout MS` | How long to wait for responses, in milliseconds (default: 1500) |
| `send` | `--pin PIN` | PIN when sending to a PIN-protected receiver |
| `send` | `--no-scan` | Do not scan for alias; use IP or fail fast |
| `send` | `--text` | Read UTF-8 text from stdin (pipe) |
| `send` | `--message TEXT` | Send inline text |
| `send` | `--clipboard` | Send plain text from the system clipboard |
| `receive` | `--dir PATH` | Directory where received files are saved (default: Downloads) |
| `receive` | `--once` | Exit after the first completed transfer |

## AI agents and automation

- **`lsend agent`** — offline progressive docs (`alias`, `scan`, `send`, `receive`, `errors`, `eval`)
- **[AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md)** — JSON schemas and exit codes
- **`skills/localsend-cli/SKILL.md`** — Cursor agent skill (copy to `.cursor/skills/`)

```bash
lsend agent
lsend scan --json --timeout 5000
lsend send 192.168.1.42 ./file.pdf --json --no-scan
lsend receive --json --once --dir /tmp/inbox
```

## Configuration

Identity (TLS certificate and fingerprint) and the device alias are stored under:

- macOS/Linux: `~/.config/lsend/`
- Windows: `%APPDATA%\lsend\`

Files:

- `cert.pem`, `key.pem`, `fingerprint.txt` — TLS identity
- `alias.txt` — persisted device name (official LocalSend word lists + system locale; override per run with `--alias`; manage with `lsend alias`)
- `receive_pin` — persisted receive PIN when set via `lsend receive --pin`

Stdout is automatically JSON when piped or when `LOCALSEND_NO_TUI=1` is set (same as `--json`).
